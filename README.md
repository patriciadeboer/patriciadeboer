# Patricia Ellia

ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Patricia. I am a Software Engineer II at [M1](https://m1.com/), a Fintech company based out of Chicago. I made a career change about 3 years ago into Software Engineering, and absolutely love it. No doubt in my mind it was the right move for me. Before becoming a software engineer, I had a whole career working as a Product & Operations Manager, leading large global teams, at NielsenIQ (formerly Nielsen). Despite loving the people I worked with, it just wasn't the right day  to day fit for me.
